        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS
        is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
        content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
        content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages
        to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
        same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such
        as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The
        name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which
        style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
        This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are
        maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
        (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March
        1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
        In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS
        including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
