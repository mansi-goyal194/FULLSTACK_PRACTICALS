        JavaScript is a high-level programming language. It was originally
      designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as
      a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular
      programming language in use[1]. JavaScript is usually found running in a
      web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup
      messages and live clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also
      commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like
      Node.js[2], or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base
      programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript
      offers. Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not
      related to the programming language Java. Though the names of both
      languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow
      different design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated
      organizations.
